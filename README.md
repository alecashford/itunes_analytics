A simple set of Python scripts that provide insights into my music listening habits. Currently the algorithm calculates both artists with highest overall play-count, as well as an "artist rank," calculated by dividing total number of seconds since the first song by that artist was added by that artists's total playcount. The insights are interesting to try yourself. Next part of the algorithm would be to provide intelligent recommendations of new music based on my musical tastes.
